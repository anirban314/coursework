## Automating Real-World Tasks with Python
### Course 6

These are the scripts relating to the final course in the specialization.
The final project (week 4) required multiple scripts to complete and
therefore needed to be put into its own folder. I have also put the other
scripts into their respective folders to stay consistent.

- **Week 1** - Manipulating Images  
- **week 2** - Interacting with Web Services  
- **week 3** - Automatic Output Generation  
- **week 4** - Putting It All Together __(Final Project)__
