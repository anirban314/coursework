## Crash Course on Python
### Course 1

This was the final assignment of the Crash Course on Python course.
This script was executed in a Jupyter Notebook as part of the assignment.
Most of the code was provided and the learner was supposed to write
only part of the code, which I have marked in the script accordingly.

### Scripts:
wordcloud.py - has module and logical dependencies
