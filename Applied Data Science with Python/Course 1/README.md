## Introduction to Data Science in Python
### Course 1

Here goes the scripts that I wrote relating to the concepts discussed
in the first course of this specialization.  

### Scripts:
Having been introduced to the exciting world of Numpy, I was thrilled
to realize I can combine the power of Numpy with Pillow. The following
two scripts are my first attempts at doing just that.  

- **lincoln-encode.py** - dependencies accounted for, should work locally
Embeds the United States Constitution into the famous Abraham Lincoln
"cracked glass plate" photograph.  

- **lincoln-decode.py** - WIP

The cypher for the above two scripts is simple: put every character in
the US constitution in every prime numbered pixel of the image, starting
from pixel number 1783 (the year the Revolutionary War ended).
