# Coursework
Repo containing course-related projects/scripts

This is my collection of all the scripts, programs, projects I wrote
as part of the various online courses I have pusued or will pursue in
the future.

PLEASE NOTE: Most of these scripts will NOT run directly on your local
machine without the modification of certain variables within the
scripts. This is because those variables contained values specific to
the environment they were intended to run on to complete the assignments.
I have marked them wherever applicable. In other cases, you will need
to install certain services on your local machine so that the scripts
may interact with said services. I have also marked them accordingly.
