## Algorithms, Stanford University
### Specialization
[Link to course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms)

Note: I did not pursue this specialization beyond the first week of the
first course as I felt it was not for me at this point in time. However,
I will absolutely resume this specialization in the near future as I
also felt that it'll be vital for my professional development in the
field of Ml/AI. Therefore, I decided to keep the course files here for
future reference.

### Scripts:
**grade3x.py**  
Has no dependencies but requires the 2 integers to be multiplied as
commandline arguments. **Example:**
> `user@pc:~$ python3 grade3x.py 1234 5678`
